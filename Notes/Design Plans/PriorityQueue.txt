Need some type of special iterator with a "skip" pattern
    - skip pattern of 1 is just a normal iter going
      left to right (breadth first)
    - skip pattern of 2 goes to every second element
      and goes through the *entire* heap, as in when
      the end is reached, goes back a visits the
      elements it didnt visit first time around

Implement the pqueue and heap in one class, do not
have them seperate

PriorityQueue:
    - have constructor with parameter of maximum height which
      pre allocates room
    - allocate an extra level of room, unlike say vector which
      allocates 1.5x more room
    - do *not* allow container choice
    - make allocator aware
